# Hugo Box

Docker container for building and deploying static websites with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Based on [debian (stable) image](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/). Additionally installed packages:

 - hugo
 - git
 - openssh-client

Designed to be used on [Wercker](https://wercker.com) to automatically and **super fast**â€”

 1. **Build** the website using Hugo when pushing to a GitHub repo
 2. **Publish** the generated website to a GitHub Pages repo (authorised by SSH key)
